        <h3>Barbell Squat Technique</h3>  
        <ul>
            
            <h2><EM>Lift Off</EM></h2>

            <p>The first step of a successful barbell squat is at the rack. Bar should be set around chest height, as setting bar too high or low can get the athlete to put themselves in a dangerous position. The next step would be to pull youself under the bar by pulling your shoulder blades together. Next step is the unracking the bar, feet should be position evenly spaced around shoulder width. Take a big breath while bracing core </p>

            <h2><EM>Descend & Bottom Position</EM></h2>

            <p>Two things are important when descenfing during foot placemnet and breathing. After unracking the bar the athlete, should take some step backwards and establish foot stance. The width would depend on how comfortable the athlete is, this would be different for everyone. The foot would have to be engaged and have a direct contact with the floor, allowing it to be stable and supporte the body. If this is done properly the foot will move into an arched position. Next step would be to form external torque at the hips, this is done by squeezing the glutes. Torque is developed at the hip joint and knees are brough into correct alignment with feet. Following step involves big breath in and tense the core. Last step involves the engagment of the glutes and hamistrings, which happens when hips are slighly pushed backwards and bring chest foward by keeping it straight. Once the hips are engaged  and the body is in balance, start squatting down by imagining your sitting down on you heels.  </p>

            <H2><em>Ascent</em></H2>

            <img class="img-ascent" src="images/IMG_2094.jpg" alt="ascent">

            <p>The ascent of the squat is all about staying balanced, from the bottom of the squat, the hips and chest should go all up at the same time.</p>
